<h1>GuessLCA</h1>
<p>
The graph shows the precision of the algorithm evolving with the number of iterations and also the source trustworthiness cosine similarity difference between 2 iterations (as convergence test), 
for 100 iterations over the Book data set.
GuessLCA reaches convergence early and is stable.
