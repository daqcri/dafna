<h1>2-Estimates</h1>
<p>
The graph shows the precision of the algorithm evolving with the number of iterations and also the source trustworthiness cosine 
similarity difference between 2 iterations (as convergence test), 
for 100 iterations over the Book data set.
2-Estimates reaches convergence early and is stable.
