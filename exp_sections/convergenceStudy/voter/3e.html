<h1>3-Estimates</h1>
<p>The graph shows the precision of the algorithm evolving with the number of iterations and also the source trustworthiness cosine similarity difference between 2 iterations (as convergence test), 
for 500 iterations over the Book data set.
3-Estimates shows an unstable behaviour in precision and convergence test over hundreds of iterations. 
Even though convergence can be reached once (with local precision minima),  3-Estimates can not reach convergence again.
