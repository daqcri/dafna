                    <h3><strong>Truth Discovery and Misinformation Dynamics in the Web    </strong>   </h3>
                <p> The evolution of the Web from a technology platform to a social 
          ecosystem has resulted in unprecedented data 
          volumes being continuously generated, exchanged, and consumed. 
          User-generated content on the Web 
          is massive, highly dynamic, and characterized by a combination 
          of factual data and opinion data.     </p>
          <p>False information, rumors, and fake contents across multiple 
          sources can be easily spread, making 
          it hard to distinguish between what is true and what is not. 
          Truth discovery also called fact-checking has recently gained lot of
           interest in Data Science communities. </p>
         <p> Ascertaining the veracity of data and understanding the dynamics of
           misinformation in the Web are two inter-dependent challenges for researchers 
           and practitioners in Databases, Information Retrieval, and Knowledge Management.</p>
                                 <div class="alert alert-danger">
          
          <strong>This tutorial explores the progress that has been made in discovering truth,
  checking facts, and modeling the propagation of falsified and distorted 
  information in the context of Big Data.</strong>
        </div>
  
   <p>
   We will review in details current 
  models, algorithms, and techniques proposed by various research communities 
  in Complex System Modeling, Data Management, and Knowledge Discovery, for 
  ascertaining the veracity of data in a dynamic world. 
   </p>
     <p>
  Finally,  this tutorial 
  will identify a wide range of open problems and research directions for 
  discovering truth from falsehood(s) in the Web Data and understanding the 
  evolution and propagation of information source trustworthiness. </p>

                     <h3><strong>Audience </strong>   </h3>
                  The tutorial is of particular relevance to:
         <ul>         
<li> Students, academic researchers, and practitioners in
databases, information retrieval, social complex systems, and more broadly data sciences</li>
<li> Business and quantitative analysts in the fields of knowledge
 and information management, statistics, and social network analysis from a wide range of industrial,
commercial and scientific applications (e.g., journalism, social media, marketing and finance)     </li>
<li> Users of social networks and social media      </li>
<li> Software engineers of large databases and social networks that use, design or develop tools for data import,
integration and analytics </li>
<li> Those interested in accuracy, truthfulness ofWeb sources
and veracity of user-generated content in the Web of
Data.         </li>

                     <div class="alert alert-danger" class="col-sm-6 col-lg-6"> Motivations</div> 
                                                <p>  The tutorial will start with a
variety of real-world examples illustrating the importance of checking veracity of online information and
understanding the dynamics of rumors and fake contents. </p>
                  <div class="alert alert-danger"> Part I - Models for Truth Discovery Computation</div> 
                 <p> The problem of truth discovery is intellectually and technically interesting enough to have attracted a lot of prior
studies from many communities from artificial intelligence,
database to information extraction communities, sometimes
investigated under the names of "fact-checking", "information trustworthiness", "information credibility", "information
corroboration" or "data fusion". In the first part of the tutorial, we will provide a comprehensive survey of existing models and algorithms
for truth discovery computation illustrated by many
examples.                             </p>
<p>We will present the main line of research
which aimed at iteratively computing and updating
the trustworthiness of a source as a function of the
belief in its claims, and then the belief score of each
claim as a function of the trustworthiness of the sources
asserting it. In this research line,
several probabilistic and optimization-based models will be presented to highlight various aspects beyond source
trustworthiness and claim belief that have been incoporated to enhance initial models.        </p>
         
                   <div class="alert alert-danger" class="col-sm-6 col-lg-6"> Part II - Dynamics of Misinformation</div> 
            <p>       This second part will provide a broad outline of past and
recent theoretical research, mainly from Statistical Physics,
around diffusion dynamics on networked systems (e.g., SIS and SIR models) and we will review work related to influence,
 rumour reach prediction, meme tracking and information mutation. It will also
illustrate how real-world data have already begun to modify such idealized setups, launching a converging research
avenue for both communities in data management and complex systems research.                </p>



               <div class="alert alert-danger" class="col-sm-6 col-lg-6">  Open Problems and Conclusions   </div>
           <p>     Finally, we will end the tutorial by discussing cutting-edge
open problems for discovering truth in settings where information from multiple 
sources and media is rapidly evolving, eventually distorted, and propagated. This tutorial will review the
challenges of truth discovery in the Web with awareness of
misinformation dynamics. We will discuss how close we are
to meeting these challenges and identify various open problems for future research in the data management community
and beyond. Truth discovery and misinformation dynamics
give clear opportunities to the CIKM community for cutting-edge research in information and knowledge management to
ultimately design systems that effectively support the fourth
"V" (Veracity) of Big Data.            </p>

                   Javier, currently a Scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI),
              received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Universitat Rovira i Virgili (URV) in Tarragona (Catalonia, Spain) in 2011. 
              Founded on interdisciplinary Physics, his research is focused on complex systems ranging from Cognitive Dynamics to Social Networks. 
              Among other appointments, he taught at the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics and at the Department of Psychology (both in URV). 
              Before moving to Qatar in 2014, he was a member of the COSNET Lab and held a position as a post-doctoral fellow at the Institute 
              for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (BIFI), which belongs to the University of Zaragoza (Spain).  </p>
           <p>   With more than 20 peer-reviewed articles, his work has been published (among others) in the EPJ Data Science, Physical Review E, 
              PLoS One, Scientific Reports or Europhysics Letters. Dr. Borge-Holthoefer has also contributed three chapters in different books 
              around the problem of disease and information spreading on complex networks.
