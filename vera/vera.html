The vision of VERA is to provide  a Web-based platform that supports the full pipeline of truth discovery from Web unstructured corpus and tweets: ranging from information extraction from raw texts and micro-texts and data fusion to truth discovery and visualization. VERA will offer several advantages over previous work as it includes: 

<ul>
<li>Extraction and fusion of multi-source information to answer a factual query defined by the user;</li>
<li>Dynamic query expansion to enlarge the set of sources and claims and collect additiional, timely evidences;</li>
<li>Combination of multiple truth discovery algorithms using active learning-based ensembling in order to effectively discover true values from conflicting ones;</li>
<li>Explanation of the truth discovery results;</li>
<li>Visualization artifacts to better understand the 
information space with disagreeing vs. agreeing sources
 and corroborating vs. conflicting claims.</li>
</ul>
