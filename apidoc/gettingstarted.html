<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a target="_blank" href="http://dafna.qcri.org">AllegatorTrack</a></li>
<li>Register yourself using a valid email id, confirm your email</li>
<li>Contact us for your access token, once you have registered and confirmed</li>
<li> The request parameters (urlencoded or json) can be given depending on the way of making the reqeust. For e.g. if you are using 'curl' to make the request,
<br><br>
<i>curl -X DELETE  http://localhost:4000/runsets/1/ -d "user_token=some_string_here"</i>
<br><br>
and 
<br><br>
<i>curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/runsets -H "Content-type: application/json" -d '{"user_token":"some_string_here" , "checked_algo": {"Accu": ["0.2", "0", "100", "0.5", "false", "true", "true", "false"] }, "general_config":["0.001", "0.8", "1", "0.4"]}'</i>
<br><br>
both are accepted. More details are given in the specific documentation pages.
<br><br>
</li>

<li>Some of the jobs you submit (for e.g. dataset upload, run algorithm(s)) take time to finish. To make the things easier for your application, we have a channel on <a target="_blank" href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>, which your application can subscribe to and be notified for the events it has been binded to. If there is any notification (such as job completion), your applicaton will be notified of this. Please note that, repeatedly requesting run statuses rather than listening to the push messages will eventually overwhelm our server, and we may choose to suspend your account. So, please go through the documentation of <a target="_blank" href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> to get a sense of how things work. Your application can subscribe to the notifications using app_id = "79143". You need to contact us for a key. We will send you the key through email to enable you to subscribe to the channel. Once you have configured your application using the app_id and key, you can bind to particular events, you wish to be notified for. for e.g.
<br><br>
<i>channel.bind('run_change', function(run){})</i> 
<br>
will notifiy in case of any change in the status of a run.
<br><br>
<i>channel.bind('dataset_change', function(dataset){})</i> 
<br>will notify you in case of any change in the status of a dataset.
